# CSCE435 Project

Our root directory contains 4 algorithms, a folder with all our Performance Evaluation work, and in input generation program

## Algorithms
- `Bitonic/`
- `MergeSort/`
- `quicksort/`
- `radix/`


##### While we do have an OETSort/ directory, this was not an algorithm we ultimatley chose. However, we chose to leave it in to show the progress we were able to make before we were forced to abandoned it. This was not considered in the final report. 

## Data
All `.cali` files can be found in the `PerformanceEval/dataFiles` directory. 

## Jupyter Notebooks
The jupyter notebooks used to generate our plots are as follows: 

- `PerformanceEval/AlgorithmComparisons.ipynb` and `PerformanceEval/WeakScalingComp.ipynb` are the notebooks we used to compare all of our algorithms together 
- `PerformanceEval/BitonicSortPlotting.ipynb` is the notebook we used to plot results for our Bitonic Sort Algorithm
- `PerformanceEval/MergeSortPlotting.ipynb` is the notebook we used to plot results for our Merge Sort Algorithm
- `PerformanceEval/RadixSortPlotting.ipynb` is the notebook we used to plot results for our Radix Sort Algorithm
- `PerformanceEval/QuickSortPlotting.ipynb` is the notebook we used to plot results for our Quick Sort Algorithm

## Report

The final report can be found in `Report.md`. A pdf version of the same report can be found in `Report.pdf`.
